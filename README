Proc-SpeedControl version 0.01
==============================

This module is meant to be used inside of a processing loop where
you'd like the regulate the rate at which work is performed.  It also
has an optional ramp-up feature so that the rate is initially slow and
increases until reaching the desired rate (if possible).

The initial use case is one where a process is able to run far faster
than is necessary and allowing it to do so could saturate an external
resource (such as a database).  This module handles computing how long
to sleep between iterations of the processing loop.
